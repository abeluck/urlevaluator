Short URL Evaluator
============

URL evaluator for android - lengthens shortened URLs for correct handling in android

This app is designed to be a short-URL unshortener. Android sometimes launches an app if it recognizes the URL, for example, a link to maps.google.com will open in the Maps app. However, this does not work for short URLs, they will open in a browser, and many browsers will then just open the mobile web site corresponding to the link. 

This app will take the short url, unshorten it, and give it back so that android can launch the correct application.

Over 350 URL-shortening services are supported!

The code is open source and available on github: http://git.io/oRGECw
